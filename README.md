# EE463-EE464 Cheat Sheet

This repo holds the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) document that you will use as a cheatsheet in the exam.
You are free to modify the cheatsheet as you wish, and all students are encouraged to contribute. 

Here are a few rules:

- All students will use the same cheat sheet. No other documents will be allowed.
- Cheat sheet will be one page (single side) A-4 document.
- The latest version of the .tex file in the "master" branch will be compiled at 13.30, Tuesday 18th of April, and the first page of the PDF output will be distributed in the exam. 

A few hints:

- Be careful when editing the .tex file if you don't know how to use LaTeX.
- If there is a specific equation you want to include, it may be better to ask your friends to do it by opening [a new issue](https://github.com/odtu/ee463-cheatsheet/issues/new).
- Actually, all the equations I presented in my slides are written with LaTeX, so you can directly copy them to your cheat-sheet. In order to do that, either go to the files [in my GitHub repo](https://github.com/ozank/ozank.github.io/tree/master/presentations), or open a .html presentation and view source (i.e. click Ctrl+U).
- You are also free to add images, but it can be tricky to compile them using an online compiler.
- Here are a few links to let you compile .tex files online, alternatively you can install a local [LaTeX compiler](https://www.tug.org/begin.html).
    - [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) (probably the best option)
    - [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/) (Another online compiler)
    - [Online compiler](http://manuels.github.io/texlive.js)
    - [Quick equation compiler](http://www.hostmath.com/)
    - [From drawing to LaTeX](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html)
    - [LaTeX Cloud Compiler](https://latexonline.cc/)

- If you have any problems, Google is your friend.
